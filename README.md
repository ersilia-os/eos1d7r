# Small World Enamine Zinc search

Small World is an index of chemical space containing more than 230B molecular substructures. Here we use the Small World API to post a query to the SmallWorld server. We sample 100 molecules within a distance of 10 specifically for the ZINC map, not the entire SmallWorld domain. Please check other small-world models available in our hub.
